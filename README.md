# 📌 Data Structures in Python

Welcome to the **Data Structures in Python** repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Python, starting with **Heaps**. It is designed for learners who want to understand how these structures work under the hood. 💡

## 🔥 Heap Data Structure

A **Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:

- **Max Heap**: The parent node is always greater than or equal to its children.
- **Min Heap**: The parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children.

### 📜 Features of Heaps

✅ Efficient **insertion and deletion** operations (O(log n))
✅ Used in **Heap Sort, Priority Queues, and Graph Algorithms**
✅ Implemented as an **array-based binary tree**

## 🛠 Implementation

### **Heap Operations Implemented**

✔️ `insert_node(element)`: Inserts an element while maintaining heap property.
✔️ `heapify(arr, size, index)`: Ensures the heap property is maintained.
✔️ `extract_max()`: Removes and returns the maximum element.
✔️ `heap_sort(arr)`: Sorts an array using heap sort algorithm.
✔️ `print_heap(arr)`: Prints the heap structure.
